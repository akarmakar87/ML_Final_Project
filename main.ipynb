F1 score combines the precision and recall metrics of classification so that a score of 0 is the worst performance and 1 is the best.

Also, we have combination of numerical and categorical features which makes our dataset ideal for using decision tree model.\n",

    "We first tried to train the model on full dataset by splitting the dataset to train (.8) and test set (.2). We used grid search to find the most optimal hyperparameters for criterion, max_depth, min_samples_leaf, and max_features and use that hyperparameters to train the new model with train dataset and test it on the test dataset. We noticed that the certain genres achieve high accuracy while the others don't. Especially, the genres with more data tends to get higher accuracy. For example, the f-1 score of genre Pop was the lowest, and the number of data in original dataset was also the lowest.\n",

    "Therefore, we downsampled the data to account for the class imbalance. After downsampling, we see that F-1 scores of genres are more evenly spread out. There are still genres that the model doesn't perform well. However, this is likely to due to the inherent characteristic of genre. For example, certain genre might be harder to distinguish than other genres because the values of features are similar to that of data from other genres.\n",

For downsampled data, we get -0.82 as correlation coefficient between Cohesion and F1-score and 0.29 as that between Separation and F1-score. We see that there is stronger negative correlation between how cohesitive the data points in genre are and how well the model performs on that genre. We see there is positive correlation between how separable genre is from other genres and how well the model performs on that genre. However, there doesn't seem to be great positive correlation as the number is small and there are lots of genres where the WSS is close to 0."

    "<p>We decided to use a Neural Network because it is good to use when the data has a lot of inputs and there is a large quanitity of training data. Additionally, it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality which is good for us since our data has a lot of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the entire dataset with 42305 records, the MLPClassifier predicted the correct genre with 66% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the dataset with anomalies removed (according to the anomaly detection process from earlier), the model's accuracy increased slightly to 68%. This could be because the records that were considered edge cases (most unlike the other records in that class) have been removed so there are fewer records that are more likely to be misclassified by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the downsampled dataset of size 5490 to mitigate for class imbalance (sampled same number of records from each class), the model's accuracy decreased to 59%. This could be because since the records from various classes are so similar (as proven by analysis on the clustering), having a lot of data was a strength of the dataset that allowed the model to pick up on more minute differences between records of different classes the more it trained. Now that there are much fewer records from each classes, it is harder for the model to differentiate between classes as well as before and it is more likely to misclassify.</p>"
